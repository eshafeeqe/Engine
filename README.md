# Engine

This project is a try to replicate Cherno's game engine series (https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlrATfBNZ98dC-V-N3m0Go4deliWHPFwT) in Linux. We are bringing following changes from his implementation.

1. CMake based build system for the project. 
2. Using Clang for compiling in Linux. 
3. Use smart pointers instead of raw pointers.
